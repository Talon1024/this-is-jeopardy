# This is Jeopardy! by Talon1024

This is my work for the "This is Jeopardy!" Codecademy project. There were many delays because I was unhappy with how the code was all put into one huge file, I was unhappy with the fact the input data was all hardcoded, and lack of motivation.

You will notice that I wrote functions to load the input data (import_export.py), and I put the input data in a separate CSV file (inputs.csv) so that it can be more easily maintained.

You will need to download jeopardy.csv from the Codecademy "This is Jeopardy!" project page.

Here's a list of my work on each task and sub-task listed in the Codecademy project:
